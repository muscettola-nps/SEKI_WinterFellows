## QA/QC fuels

Lets use this Rmd as a place to work through the qa/qc function with our fuels data...

```{r cars}
getwd()
library(here)
here()
#load data 
Fuels_1000s <- read.csv(here("data","Surface Fuels - 1000Hr_XPT.csv"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
